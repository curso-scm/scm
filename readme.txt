This is now so much more than a readme file. It is something
altogether different.  I know, this is still a readme file.  It does
not have many of the features of a readme file, though.  In fact, I
find it lacking in almost any aspect I can think of.  However, it has
become my example file to show the student the amazing capabilities of
Git. So, I'll use it anyway.
